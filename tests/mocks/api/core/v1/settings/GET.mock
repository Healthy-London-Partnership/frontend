It will take a few weeks for us to offer the full range of support offers that we\u2019d like.\n\nMany thanks to Kingston Council and the Work and Health Unit for making this site possible."

NHS Connect changes that by drawing on aggregated data sets on scale, putting providers in charge of their listings - with tools and nudges to keep them uptodate - and then using sophisticated technologies to match a person with the ideal package of support for them.\n\nBut our goal is not just about giving people access to trusted information about support opportunities, vital though that is; it is also about ensuring that money is available to fund the right support for this person, now \u2013 not later on when their needs have often grown more complex, difficult and costly to solve.\n\nThis challenge is all the greater in the UK, which has long had both a mixed economy for health, with employers and health insurance operating in a quite separate space from the NHS, and also fragmented funding and support across different arms of central and local government. There is also a messy but critical role for personal budgets and self-funding.\n\nVery often funders don\u2019t have the budget and the business case on their own to do the right thing, but together we can.\n\nSo if you\u2019re an Integrated Care System, or an insurance company or an enlightened employer, or you just share our passion to pool funding together to transform health outcomes and protect our NHS in the process, please get in touch. We have some big plans for 2021."

You can use the system to help clients search for support based on what matters to them, make referrals and then receive follow-up information on levels of engagement, satisfaction and outcomes achieved.\n\nGPs can combine Connect with use of platforms such as AccuRx, iPlato or MJog to mass message patients presenting heightened risk for specific health problems such as Mental Health or Musculo-skeletal pain, or share by phone, email, or in consultations; giving a strong nudge to increased self-management, improved wellbeing and reduced reliance on GP services in the future.\n\nEmployment support staff such as Disability Employment Advisers can use Connect to give claimants access to wrap around support that will boost both health and employment outcomes.\n\nCouncil staff, for example in Public Health, Neighbourhood Services and especially those areas committed to local integrated teamwork, can use Connect to access all local public services alongside a wealth of third sector and national offers; making existing resources stretch much further.\n\nWe recommend that you start with playing with the platform as it is right now, but please bear in mind that the service is still in Public Beta and we still have many improvements in the pipeline. This includes integration shortly with other digital systems such as leading Client Management Systems for social prescribing, for maximum ease and effectiveness.\n\nWant to learn more? We are running a series of drop-in webinars for busy professionals that give you a quick tour of the system and explain our roots in a model of tackling health inequality at its roots and addressing the social and psychological as well as physical needs of people in being well and in control of their lives.\n\nYou might also want to join our Co-design Coalition to get advance knowledge of what is coming next and help us to co-design and test key pieces of functionality so they work for you.\n\nIf your area wants to start making referrals through the platform, a senior staff member will need to sign off the request, you\u2019ll need send us a list of approved supporters and we\u2019ll give them access to enhanced roles and permissions within the platform. Please email hlp.admin.connect@nhs.net to make this happen."
